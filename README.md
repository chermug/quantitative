Introduction
============

The CHERMUG project aims to develop a digital game to support students in learning about research methods and statistics. The main activity to achieve this goal is the design, development and deployment of an educational game to support teachers in research methods courses.

Quantitative Data Analysis Game
===============================

The main goal of this activity is to allow the students to understand the different possible approaches to study quantitative data. Data Analysis is a very big subject to cover in such a short time frame, and students need to be able to grasp the key fundamentals of analysing data. 


The mini game offers students a graphical quiz with added game elements to make the experience more interesting

Theoretical content to be reflected
-----------------------------------

Variations of measurement
•	Nominal Scales – Nominal measures offer names or labels for certain characteristics. Eg. Gender and Race.

•	Ordinal Scales – Describes order, but not relative size or degree of difference between the items measured Values on an ordinal scale represent the rank order of the subjects with respect to the variable being assessed. For example, the preceding table includes one variable called Rank that represents the rank ordering of subjects according to their overall effectiveness as agents.

•	Interval Scales – With an interval scale, equal differences between scale values do have equal quantitative meaning. For this reason, an interval scale provides more quantitative information than the ordinal scale 

A good example of an interval scale is the Fahrenheit degree scale used to measure temperature. With the Fahrenheit scale, the difference between 70 degrees and 75 degrees is equal to the difference between 80 degrees and 85 degrees: The units of measurement are equal throughout the full range of the scale.  

•	Ratio Scales – are similar to interval scales in that equal differences between scale values have equal quantitative meaning. However, ratio scales also have a true zero point, which gives them an additional property.
